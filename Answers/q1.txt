The fastest animal in the world is the peregrine falcon, which can reach speeds of up to 389 km/h (242 mph) during its characteristic hunting dive, known as a stoop. This makes it not only the fastest animal but also one of the fastest animals on record.

However, if we're talking about land animals, the fastest animal is the cheetah, which can reach speeds of up to 120 km/h (75 mph). The cheetah's speed is due to its slender body, long legs, and powerful muscles, which allow it to cover ground quickly when chasing prey.

Other fast animals include:

* Pronghorn antelope: up to 96 km/h (60 mph)
* Thomson's gazelle: up to 90 km/h (56 mph)
* Springbok: up to 88 km/h (55 mph)
* Lion: up to 80 km/h (50 mph)

It's worth noting that these speeds are based on recorded observations and may vary depending on the source.
