The top speed of a falcon can vary depending on the species, but some of the fastest falcons are:

* Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus): Up to 242 mph (390 km/h) during its characteristic hunting dive, known as a stoop.
* Gyrfalcon (Falco rusticolus): Up to 200 mph (322 km/h)
* Lanner Falcon (Falco biarmicus): Up to 186 mph (299 km/h)

It's worth noting that these speeds are only achieved during short periods of diving or stooping, and falcons typically cruise at much slower speeds when gliding or perched.
