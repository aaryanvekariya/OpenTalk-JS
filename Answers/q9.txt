There are 5 oceans in the world:

1. Pacific Ocean
2. Atlantic Ocean
3. Indian Ocean
4. Arctic Ocean
5. Southern Ocean (also known as the Antarctic Ocean)

Note: The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognized the Southern Ocean as the fifth ocean in 2000, defining it as the waters surrounding Antarctica.

However, some sources still consider only four oceans:

1. Pacific Ocean
2. Atlantic Ocean
3. Indian Ocean
4. Arctic Ocean

The reason for this debate is due to the definition of an "ocean". Some argue that the Southern Ocean meets the criteria for an ocean (i.e., it's a body of saltwater that covers over 20% of the Earth's surface) and should be considered as such.

But regardless of how many oceans you count, one thing is clear: our planet has plenty of amazing bodies of water to explore and protect!
