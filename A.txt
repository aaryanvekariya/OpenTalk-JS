That's close, but not entirely accurate. The fastest animal in the world is actually the Peregrine Falcon, but it doesn't quite reach speeds of up to 389 km/h during its stoop.

According to various sources, including the Guinness World Records, the Peregrine Falcon can reach speeds of up to 389 km/h (242 mph) during its characteristic hunting dive, known as a stoop. However, when gliding or cruising, the average speed is indeed around 50-60 km/h (31-37 mph).

It's worth noting that there are other animals, like migratory birds and fish, that can reach high speeds during short bursts or while chasing prey, but these speeds are often not sustained over long periods. The Peregrine Falcon's dive speed remains the fastest recorded speed for any animal to this day.

I hope that helps clarify things!
